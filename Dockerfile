# The yt-dlp binary that youtube-dl-exec downloads is the plain release asset:
# a Python zipapp with a `#!/usr/bin/env python3` shebang, so it needs a system
# python3 at runtime. This actor only pulls metadata + thumbnails (no video
# download / stream merging), so ffmpeg is intentionally NOT installed.

# Install dependencies first to leverage Docker layer caching.
# youtube-dl-exec downloads the yt-dlp binary during postinstall (needs network).
